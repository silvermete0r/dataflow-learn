# Linear Algebra for Machine Learning

## Overview
Understanding the fundamental building blocks of ML mathematics.

## Contents
1. Vectors & Scalars
2. Matrices & Operations
3. Linear Transformations
4. Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors

## Prerequisites
- Basic mathematics knowledge
- Python programming basics

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, you will:
- Understand vector and matrix operations
- Apply linear transformations
- Implement basic linear algebra operations in NumPy

## Vectors & Scalars: Intuitive Understanding

Imagine vectors as arrows in space. They have both direction and magnitude, while scalars are just simple numbers.

### Key Concepts
- Vectors as arrows in space
- Vector operations (addition, subtraction)
- Scalar multiplication

## Matrices & Matrix Operations

Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers that help us organize and transform data efficiently.

### Why Matrices Matter in ML
- Data organization
- Linear transformations
- Feature representation

## Dot Product & Matrix Multiplication

## Hands-on Practice
```python
import numpy as np

# Vector operations example
v1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
v2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
dot_product = np.dot(v1, v2)
```

## Linear Transformations

Understanding how matrices can transform space through:
- Scaling
- Rotation
- Projection

## Assessment
- Practice problems
- Interactive coding exercises
- Quiz
